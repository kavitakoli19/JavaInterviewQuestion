## Stratergy Desgign Pattern : 
  - Collections.sort() method and the Comparator interface
  -Collections.sort() method and the Comparator interface, which is a strategy interface and defines a strategy for comparing objects. Because of this pattern, we don't need to       modify the sort() method (closed for modification) to compare any object; at the same time, we can implement a Comparator interface to define a new comparing strategy (open       for extension).This pattern is actually based upon the open-closed design principle
